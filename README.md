### June versus December Temperatures
* The average temperatures are warmer in June than in December. 
* The range of temperatures is greater for December than for June. 
* The difference between the average temperatures for both June and December is only 3.9 degrees. We are certain that an ice cream and surf shop would be ideal in a summer month such as June; so with only a 3.9 degree difference in average temperature, December appears to be a relatively comparable month to June for weather and thusly would be a comparable month for sales.
